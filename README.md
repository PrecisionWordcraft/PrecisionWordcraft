- 👋 Hi, I’m A. Elizabeth Brown, principal writer, editor, and translator at Precision Wordcraft LLC, a/k/a @PrecisionWordcraft. I go by "Elizabeth" and use she / they pronounds.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning (human) languages, using them gracefully, and translating from several Romance languages into US and UK English. I also will write SQL for free but don't tell anyone!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Andalus ways of speech, vocabulary, and the EPA standard for Andalus orthography proposed by the linguists and developers of the AndaluGeeks (https://andaluh.es/) community. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Spanish language works to transcribe into Andalus, translate into English, and display on my portfolio site... or sell! 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
